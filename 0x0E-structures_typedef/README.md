Project 0x0E. C - structures, typedef

## TASKs
TASK 0: (dog.h) - Defined a new type struct dog which as name, age, 
and owner as elements.
	Included prototypes of all other tasks in header dog.h

TASK 1: (1-init_dog.c) - initializes a variable of type struct dog

TASK 2: (2-print_dog.c) - function prints a struct dog
TASK 3: (dog.h) - defined a new type name 'dog_t' for type struct dog
	using typedef
TASK 4: (4-new_dog.c) - Creates a new dog.
	- Utilizes strlen to find length of inputs
	- Utilizes strcpy to copy from struct member to new
TASK 5: (5-free_dog.c) - Free's dogs (AKA free's the memory they reside on)

## Thoughts
Interesting concepts, though I can't imagine a situation a developer would
choose to implement typedef as it probab;y just makes it ambiguous.

Structure great for grouping variables ike, Name, Phone, Email, Age... of a 
person or organization. Accessing structure is a bit confusing, however.
